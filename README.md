I’m a tech-savvy professional with a passion for modern technologies. I’m currently re-learning design patterns, data structures, and programming languages. I’m also practicing my English and would love to get fluid. I’m excited to bring my skills and experience to the table and work with you to create innovative solutions that drive success.

I have experience working with a variety of programming languages, including Python, Java, and C++. I’m also familiar with a range of design patterns and data structures, and I’m always eager to learn more.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, games and experimenting with different programming languages. I’m also like to read and enjoy learning about new topics in technology and business.

If you’re interested in collaborating on a project or just want to chat about technology, feel free to reach out to me. I’m always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow!
